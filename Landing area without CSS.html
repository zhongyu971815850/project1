<p>Hi, I am Yu. I am a senior student majoring in CECS (Computer Engineering and Computer Science track). 
    I was born and raised in Guangzhou, China, and after taking the college entrance exam in my hometown, 
    I discussed with my parents and they agreed to send me to the United States—the most powerful country 
    in the world—for college, because I wanted to broaden my horizons and gain international work & study 
    experience. I have several hobbies like traveling,  writing novels and poems, and playing the piano, etc. 
    Among those things that I fond of, I would like to mention that I really enjoy having conversations with
     people from different cultural backgrounds and upbringings because I believe I can always learn something 
     from them. During the years I have spent in the U.S., my English level and my Spanish proficiency has 
     significantly improved thanks to all the good friends I have made. Also,  I have a relatively sentimental
      personality which led to my obsession in appreciating literature, art, classical music and architecture 
      in my early age, but later on I discovered that there exist a vivid form of art that can combine all of them
       associatively -- a well made game. This posed a strong influence on me in a way that I made my decision to choose 
       computer graphics track in my senior year. In my leisure time, I also play video games and note down 
       the impressive gameplay I experience, so that I can learn from the classic or creative plots and 
       aesthetic designs. I enjoy learning animation using game engines like UE5 as well.
