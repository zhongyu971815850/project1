                <p2>
                    My father was once a professor of computer science. During the early days when single-player
                    RPG games were popular in China, he often bought game discs to play at home. The bizarre and colorful
                    visuals, along with the tragic yet enduring storylines, fascinated me deeply.
                    As I grew older, I wanted to promote games as a form of the ninth art, especially today,
                    with the rapid development of AR, VR and AI. The breakthroughs in GPU performance
                    also have made an even more immersive experience possible
