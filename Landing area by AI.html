<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hi, I am Yu. I am a senior student majoring in CECS (Computer Engineering and Computer Science track). 
    I was born and raised in Guangzhou, China, and after taking the college entrance exam in my hometown, 
    I discussed with my parents, and they agreed to send me to the United States—the most powerful country 
    in the world—for college, because I wanted to broaden my horizons and gain international work & study 
    experience. I have several hobbies like traveling, writing novels and poems, and playing the piano, etc. 
    Among those things that I am fond of, I would like to mention that I really enjoy having conversations with
    people from different cultural backgrounds and upbringings because I believe I can always learn something 
    from them. During the years I have spent in the U.S., my English level and my Spanish proficiency have 
    significantly improved, thanks to all the good friends I have made. Also, I have a relatively sentimental
    personality, which led to my obsession with appreciating literature, art, classical music, and architecture 
    at an early age, but later on, I discovered that there exists a vivid form of art that can combine all of them
    associatively—a well-made game. This posed a strong influence on me in a way that I made my decision to choose 
    the computer graphics track in my senior year. In my leisure time, I also play video games and note down 
    the impressive gameplay I experience, so that I can learn from the classic or creative plots and 
    aesthetic designs. I enjoy learning animation using game engines like UE5 as well.
