                    Hi, I am Yu. I am a senior student majoring in CECS (Computer Engineering and Computer Science track).
                    I was born and raised in Guangzhou, China, and after taking the college entrance exam in my hometown,
                    I discussed with my parents and they agreed to send me to the United States -- the most powerful country
                    in the world -- for college, because I wanted to broaden my horizons and gain international work & study
                    experience. I have several hobbies like traveling, writing novels and poems, and playing the piano, etc.
                    Among those things that I fond of, I would like to mention that I really enjoy having conversations with
                    people from different cultural backgrounds and upbringings because I believe I can always learn something
                    from them. During the years I have spent in the U.S., my English level and my Spanish proficiency has
                    significantly improved thanks to all the good friends I have made. Also, I have a relatively sentimental
                    personality which led to my obsession in appreciating literature, art, classical music and architecture
                    in my early age, but later on I discovered that there exist a vivid form of art that can combine all of them
                    associatively -- a well made game. This posed a strong influence on me in a way that I made my decision to choose
                    computer graphics track in my senior year. In my leisure time, I also play video games and note down
                    the impressive gameplay I experience, so that I can learn from the classic or creative plots and
                    aesthetic designs. I enjoy learning animation using game engines like UE5 as well.
